# Food Overhaul - Vanilla Foods

This is a library of food effects. It does nothing on its own.

The effects are meant to be used with the mod [Food Overhaul](https://modrinth.com/mod/food-overhaul), but can of course be used for other purposes as well.

These effects affect the player in various ways, like increasing health, stamina or mana.
More exotic food increases attributes like frost resistance.

Most of these attributes are provided by the mods [Health Regeneration Overhaul](https://modrinth.com/mod/health-regeneration-overhaul), [Mana Attributes](https://modrinth.com/mod/mana-attributes), [Overhauled Damage](https://modrinth.com/mod/overhauled-damage) and [Stamina Attributes](https://modrinth.com/mod/stamina-attributes).
